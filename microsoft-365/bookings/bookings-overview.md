Use Bookings to make your organization’s meetings virtual with online meetings via [Microsoft Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/overview-of-the-bookings-app-in-teams-7b8569e1-0c8a-444e-b712-d9968b05110b) and Skype for Business. Each appointment booked as an online meeting creates a unique meeting link that is sent to attendees so they can join via a web browser, phone dial-in, or the Skype or Teams app. Bookings is also available as an app in Teams and Outlook, which allows you to create Booking pages, declare your availability, add team members, and both schedule new and manage existing appointments. 

## Personal Bookings 

Personal bookings is how you manage your own appointment timeslots, it allows you to easily configure and share your availability with your customers, clients, or colleagues. You can be in charge of your own time and avoid the back and forth of scheduling. You can also set aside time for specific activities by creating meeting types. Once you create a personal booking page, you can share a link with anyone who can then see your availability and easily schedule a time when you are free and is convenient for them.

## Shared Bookings 

Shared bookings are booking pages that you create and manage for your team. They allow you to invite your team members to let your customers book time with you and your team. 

It is made up of these components: 

A booking page where your customers and clients can schedule appointments with the staff members who should provide the service or run the appointment. This web-based booking page can be shared via a direct link, your Facebook page, and even through link embedding within your website. 

A web app that contains a set of web-based, business-facing pages where Booking page owners and administrators within an organization can define appointment types and details, manage staff schedules and availability, set business hours, and customize how appointments are scheduled. These pages allow for versatility and the ability to customize a booking page to fit the diverse needs of the person or organization.
